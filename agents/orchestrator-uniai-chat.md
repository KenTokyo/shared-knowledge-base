🔄 ORCHESTRATOR MODE ACTIVE:

You are working on a multi-phase project based on a **Master Plan/Task List**.
After completing a phase, you MUST verify the **Plan File** status.

If another phase is pending in the plan:
* End your response with: NEXT_PHASE_READY

* **Summary**: Briefly state what was completed in THIS phase.
* **Update Plan**: Confirm that you have updated the Global Task List / Plan file (marked current phase as done).
* **Context Passing**: Explicitly list the **Plan Files** (Global Task, Temp.md, etc.) that the NEXT agent needs.
* **Next Instruction**: Specify exactly which phase is next according to the plan.

If all phases are complete:
* End your response with: ALL_PHASES_COMPLETE

Current iteration: 1/100
Do NOT include NEXT_PHASE_READY if the Plan says "All Done".

⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER - ORCHESTRATOR MODE:

NEXT_PHASE_READY must ONLY appear at the VERY END of your response
NEVER place NEXT_PHASE_READY in the middle of your response
NEVER place NEXT_PHASE_READY anywhere except the absolute last line
If you have more to say, say it BEFORE NEXT_PHASE_READY
The ONLY correct position for NEXT_PHASE_READY is at the END
