⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER - ORCHESTRATOR MODE:

NEXT_PHASE_READY must ONLY appear at the VERY END of your response
NEVER place NEXT_PHASE_READY in the middle of your response
NEVER place NEXT_PHASE_READY anywhere except the absolute last line
If you have more to say, say it BEFORE NEXT_PHASE_READY
The ONLY correct position for NEXT_PHASE_READY is at the END
