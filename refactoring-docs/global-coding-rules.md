# Global Coding Rules

This guide provides comprehensive coding rules for building robust, performant, and maintainable applications. It covers Next.js App Router, React best practices, and our custom design patterns.

## üöÄ Next.js App Router Rules

### 1. Component Architecture & Boundaries

*   **Rule 1.1 (Server vs. Client):** Components are **Server Components by default**. Only use the `"use client"` directive for components that require interactivity (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, event listeners).
*   **Rule 1.2 (Placement of `use client`):** Place the `"use client"` directive at the "leaf" of the component tree. Avoid placing it in root layouts or pages to maximize the benefits of Server Components.
*   **Rule 1.3 (Isolate Interactivity):** Extract interactive logic into its own Client Component instead of turning a large Server Component into a Client Component.
*   **Rule 1.4 (Server Components as Children):** You can pass Server Components as `children` to Client Components. This pattern allows you to keep data fetching and logic on the server while wrapping it with client-side state or context providers.
*   **Rule 1.5 (Third-Party Components):** Wrap third-party components that use client-side hooks (`useState`, etc.) in your own Client Component. If they access browser APIs, use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`.

---

### 2. Data Fetching & Management

*   **Rule 2.1 (Direct Fetching):** Fetch data directly within Server Components using `async/await`. Avoid creating unnecessary API routes (`Route Handlers`) for simple data retrieval.
*   **Rule 2.2 (Parallel Fetching):** Fetch independent data in parallel using `Promise.all` to prevent request waterfalls and improve load times.
*   **Rule 2.3 (Automatic Caching):** Next.js automatically caches `fetch` requests. Embrace multiple, co-located `fetch` calls for the same data; they won't result in duplicate requests. For ORMs or other libraries, use `React.cache`.
*   **Rule 2.4 (Dynamic Routes & Params):** Access dynamic route segments in page components via the `params` prop (e.g., `ProductPage({ params })`). To read URL search parameters without a server round-trip, use the `useSearchParams` hook in a Client Component.
*   **Rule 2.5 (Cascading Data Pattern):** Follow our 3-level data fetching pattern (see Design Pattern Rules below): Page-level for critical data, Section-level for main queries, Component-level for specific data.

*   **Rule 2.5.1 (`use()` Hook Pattern):** For interactive Client Components that need server-fetched data: Start the fetch on the server (without `await`) to get a promise. Pass this promise as a prop to the Client Component and consume it with `use(promise)`. This is the fastest way to load server data in interactive components.
*   **Rule 2.5.2 (Suspense Integration):** Always wrap components using the `use()` hook pattern in a `<Suspense>` boundary on the server. This provides an instant loading fallback and prevents the UI from being blocked.
*   **Rule 2.5.3 (Avoid `useEffect` for Initial Data):** Do not use `useEffect` to fetch initial data in Client Components. This pattern is slow, causes rendering waterfalls, and negates the benefits of server-side data fetching.
*   **Rule 2.5.4 (Distribute Promises with Context):** When multiple Client Components need the same server-fetched data, distribute the promise via a React Context Provider. This prevents redundant data fetches and keeps the code clean (no prop-drilling).

---

### 3. Data Mutations & State Updates

*   **Rule 3.1 (Use Server Actions):** Use Server Actions for all data mutations (e.g., form submissions, updates, deletions). They can be called from both Server and Client Components.
*   **Rule 3.2 (UI Updates after Mutation):** After a mutation in a Server Action, use `revalidatePath('/')` or `revalidateTag('tag')` to invalidate the cache and trigger a UI update.
*   **Rule 3.3 (Security):** **Always** validate user input and authenticate the profile session with profile-finder within your Server Actions to prevent security vulnerabilities.

---

### 4. Rendering, Loading & Secrets

*   **Rule 4.1 (Suspense Boundaries):** Use `loading.tsx` for route-level loading UI. For component-level loading with animations, see our Design Pattern Rules below for the complete animated loading system.
*   **Rule 4.2 (Re-triggering Suspense):** To force a Suspense boundary to re-trigger when props change (e.g., a search query), pass a unique `key` prop to it (e.g., `<Suspense key={query}>`).
*   **Rule 4.3 (Static vs. Dynamic Rendering):** Avoid using dynamic functions like `cookies()`, `headers()`, or the `searchParams` prop in Server Components, as this opts the entire route into dynamic rendering.
*   **Rule 4.4 (Environment Variables):** Store secrets in `.env.local`. Only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep API keys and database secrets server-only (no prefix).
*   **Rule 4.5 (Code Execution Guarantees):** Use the `server-only` package to guarantee that a module can only be imported by Server Components. Use `client-only` for modules with browser-only APIs.
*   **Rule 4.6 (Hydration):** Ensure the initial UI rendered on the server is identical to the client. For intentional differences (e.g., timestamps), use `useEffect` to update the value on the client or add the `suppressHydrationWarning` prop.
*   **Rule 4.7 (Redirects):** The `redirect()` function from `next/navigation` works by throwing an error. Do not place it inside a `try...catch` block, as the `catch` will prevent the redirect from working.
*   **Rule 4.8 (Static-First Loading):** Always render static UI elements (headers, titles, descriptions, navigation) OUTSIDE of Suspense boundaries. Only wrap dynamic, data-dependent content in Suspense. This ensures critical UI appears instantly (0ms) while data loads progressively.

## ‚öõÔ∏è React Best Practices

### 1. State & Props Management

*   **Rule 1.1 (Immutable State):** Always treat state as immutable. Use state setters (`setState` or `setMyState`) with functional updates (`prev => ...`) for safe and predictable updates, especially for batched or asynchronous operations.
*   **Rule 1.2 (List Keys):** Always provide a stable and unique `key` prop for each element when rendering lists with `.map()`. This is crucial for efficient rendering, state preservation, and avoiding bugs.
*   **Rule 1.3 (State vs. Ref):** Use `useState` for values that should trigger a re-render when they change. Use `useRef` for mutable values that *do not* require a re-render on change (e.g., managing focus, storing interval IDs, accessing DOM elements).

---

### 2. Performance Optimization

*   **Rule 2.1 (Memoization):** Prevent unnecessary re-renders to keep the UI fast and responsive.
    *   Wrap expensive, pure calculations in `useMemo`.
    *   Wrap function definitions passed as props to memoized child components in `useCallback`.
    *   Wrap components in `React.memo` to prevent them from re-rendering if their props have not changed.
*   **Rule 2.2 (UI Blocking):** Avoid running expensive, blocking computations directly in the render body. Offload them using `useMemo` or, for very heavy tasks, consider moving them to a web worker.

---

### 3. Effects & Lifecycle

*   **Rule 3.1 (Effect Cleanup):** Always provide a cleanup function in `useEffect` when setting up subscriptions, timers, or event listeners. This is critical to prevent memory leaks.
*   **Rule 3.2 (Accurate Dependency Arrays):** Always provide an accurate dependency array for `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`.
    *   An empty array (`[]`) runs the effect only once on mount.
    *   Omitting the array causes the effect to run on *every single render*.
*   **Rule 3.3 (Avoid Unnecessary Effects):** Do not use `useEffect` for logic that can be derived directly from props or state during rendering. Also, avoid it for actions that can be handled directly within event handlers.

---

### 4. Error Handling

*   **Rule 4.1 (Error Boundaries):** Wrap critical component trees in an Error Boundary component. This catches rendering errors in child components, displays a fallback UI, and prevents the entire application from crashing.

## üóÇÔ∏è Component Architecture & File Structure

### Core Philosophy: UI mirrors Folder Structure

Our primary goal is **instant navigation**: A developer should be able to find any component's code file in **under 5 seconds** just by looking at the UI. This is achieved by mirroring the UI's visual hierarchy directly in the file system.

---

### The Blueprint: Section-Based Architecture

We organize features into `(sections)` which are Next.js Route Groups. This allows for logical grouping without affecting the URL.

#### ‚úÖ **The Right Way: Clean, Section-Based Structure**

A feature's components are organized into sub-folders that represent distinct UI areas.

```
app/feature/[param]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (mainSection)/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (subSection)/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AktionButton.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ KonfigPanel.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainSection.tsx          ‚Üê Section orchestrator
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (otherSubSection)/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DataCard.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
```
*   **Clarity:** It's immediately clear that `AktionButton.tsx` belongs to `(subSection)`.
*   **Scalability:** New related components are added to the correct section, preventing clutter.
*   **Ownership:** Teams can work on different sections with minimal merge conflicts.

#### ‚ùå **The Anti-Pattern: The "Junk Drawer" `components` Folder**

Avoid creating a single, flat `components` folder within a feature route. This quickly becomes a chaotic "junk drawer" where no one can find anything.

**Example of what NOT to do (based on a real-world messy `app/chat`):**
```
app/chat/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components/             <- ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AiChatDialog.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AiChatHistoryList.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatHeader.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ChatInput.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MessageActions.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SaveChatDialog.tsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (20+ more files)
```
*   **No Context:** Which dialog belongs to which button? Is `ChatHeader` for the main page or a modal?
*   **Unscalable:** With 20+ components, this folder is impossible to navigate.
*   **High Friction:** Finding a specific component requires searching or guesswork, wasting valuable time.

---

### Component Naming Conventions

#### 1. Component Types

Use suffixes to identify a component's purpose at a glance.

*   `...Button.tsx`: Interactive triggers (e.g., `SpeichernButton.tsx`).
*   `...Dialog.tsx`: Modal overlays (e.g., `Best√§tigenDialog.tsx`).
*   `...Panel.tsx`: Input or configuration interfaces (e.g., `EinstellungenPanel.tsx`).
*   `...Section.tsx`: The main orchestrator for a `(section)` folder.

#### 2. Language: German vs. English

The language depends on who the component is for: the **user** or the **developer**.

*   **üá©üá™ German (User-Facing):** If the user sees or interacts with it directly, name it in German.
    *   `SpeichernButton.tsx` (User clicks "Speichern").
    *   `EinstellungenDialog.tsx` (User sees "Einstellungen" title).
*   **üá∫üá∏ English (Technical/Structural):** If it's a structural or technical container, name it in English.
    *   `ReviewSection.tsx` (Organizes the review area).
    *   `ProductCard.tsx` (A reusable data display block).

## üé¨ Design Pattern: Animated Loading States

Our application uses a "Static-First" loading strategy to create a perception of instant performance. Critical UI (like headers) appears immediately, while dynamic content loads progressively with staggered animations.

This creates a smooth, high-quality user experience and avoids jarring layout shifts.

**For a complete guide with code examples and implementation blueprints, see:**
**‚û°Ô∏è [`shared-docs/refactoring-docs/patterns/animated-loading-states.md`](shared-docs/refactoring-docs/patterns/animated-loading-states.md)**

---

### üìä Design Pattern: Multi-Level Data Fetching

We use a cascading, multi-level data fetching pattern to optimize for perceived performance. Data is fetched at three levels: Page, Section, and Component. This ensures critical data appears instantly, while heavier data loads progressively.

**For a complete guide with code examples and implementation blueprints, see:**
**‚û°Ô∏è [`shared-docs/refactoring-docs/patterns/multi-level-data-fetching.md`](shared-docs/refactoring-docs/patterns/multi-level-data-fetching.md)**

### üö® Safety Net: Key Edge Cases & Anti-Patterns

*   **SEO:** Ensure critical SEO content (like `h1`, `meta description`) is rendered on the server and is not dependent on client-side animation.
*   **Layout Shift (CLS):** Reserve space for loading elements using skeletons or fixed-height containers to prevent content from jumping.
*   **Slow APIs:** For components that might take too long, consider a timeout that shows a simplified fallback state.
*   **‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN:** Do not animate the main page layout container. Animate the *content inside* the layout.
*   **‚ùå ANTI-PATTERN:** Do not apply the same delay to multiple elements. The goal is a staggered, not a grouped, reveal.
*   **‚ùå DATA ANTI-PATTERN:** Never fetch all data at page level - this blocks the entire page render
*   **‚ùå DATA ANTI-PATTERN:** Don't create separate queries for each small piece of data - batch related queries
*   **‚ùå DATA ANTI-PATTERN:** Avoid waterfall loading where Component A waits for Component B's data
*   **‚ùå TAB ANTI-PATTERN:** NEVER put server fetching/Suspense in Tab Components - causes 1000ms+ delays per tab switch

---

## üö® Design Pattern: High-Performance Tab Components

Tab-Komponenten d√ºrfen **niemals eigene Daten-Fetches** durchf√ºhren, um Ladezeiten von >1000ms bei jedem Tab-Wechsel zu vermeiden. Das Data-Fetching ist die alleinige Verantwortung der **Parent-Komponente** (z.B. `NavbarClient`), und die Daten werden √ºber Props weitergegeben.
