Migration from v7
If you are migrating from rolldown-vite, the technical preview release for Rolldown integrated Vite for v6 & v7, only the sections with NRV in the title are applicable.

Default Browser Target Change NRV
The default browser value of build.target and 'baseline-widely-available', is updated to newer browser version:

Chrome 107 → 111
Edge 107 → 111
Firefox 104 → 114
Safari 16.0 → 16.4
These browser versions align with Baseline Widely Available feature sets as of 2026-01-01. In other words, they were all released about two and a half years ago.

Rolldown
Vite 8 uses Rolldown and Oxc based tools instead of esbuild and Rollup.

Gradual Migration
The rolldown-vite package implements Vite 7 with Rolldown, without other Vite 8 changes. This can be used as a intermediate step to migrate to Vite 8. See the Rolldown Integration guide in the Vite 7 docs to switch to rolldown-vite from Vite 7.

For users migrating from rolldown-vite to Vite 8, you can undo the dependency changes in package.json and update to Vite 8:

{
"devDependencies": {
"vite": "npm:rolldown-vite@7.2.2"
"vite": "^8.0.0"
}
}
Dependency Optimizer Now Uses Rolldown
Rolldown is now used for dependency optimization instead of esbuild. Vite still supports optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions for backward compatibility by converting it to optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions automatically. optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions is now deprecated and will be removed in the future and we encourage you to migrate to optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions.

The following options are converted automatically:

esbuildOptions.minify -> rolldownOptions.output.minify
esbuildOptions.treeShaking -> rolldownOptions.treeshake
esbuildOptions.define -> rolldownOptions.transform.define
esbuildOptions.loader -> rolldownOptions.moduleTypes
esbuildOptions.preserveSymlinks -> !rolldownOptions.resolve.symlinks
esbuildOptions.resolveExtensions -> rolldownOptions.resolve.extensions
esbuildOptions.mainFields -> rolldownOptions.resolve.mainFields
esbuildOptions.conditions -> rolldownOptions.resolve.conditionNames
esbuildOptions.keepNames -> rolldownOptions.output.keepNames
esbuildOptions.platform -> rolldownOptions.platform
esbuildOptions.plugins -> rolldownOptions.plugins (partial support)
You can get the options set by the compatibility layer from the configResolved hook:

const plugin = {
name: 'log-config',
configResolved(config) {
console.log('options', config.optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions)
},
},
JavaScript Transforms by Oxc
Oxc is now used for JavaScript transformation instead of esbuild. Vite still supports the esbuild option for backward compatibility by converting it to oxc automatically. esbuild is now deprecated and will be removed in the future and we encourage you to migrate to oxc.

The following options are converted automatically:

esbuild.jsxInject -> oxc.jsxInject
esbuild.include -> oxc.include
esbuild.exclude -> oxc.exclude
esbuild.jsx -> oxc.jsx
esbuild.jsx: 'preserve' -> oxc.jsx: 'preserve'
esbuild.jsx: 'automatic' -> oxc.jsx: { runtime: 'automatic' }
esbuild.jsxImportSource -> oxc.jsx.importSource
esbuild.jsx: 'transform' -> oxc.jsx: { runtime: 'classic' }
esbuild.jsxFactory -> oxc.jsx.pragma
esbuild.jsxFragment -> oxc.jsx.pragmaFrag
esbuild.jsxDev -> oxc.jsx.development
esbuild.jsxSideEffects -> oxc.jsx.pure
esbuild.define -> oxc.define
esbuild.banner -> custom plugin using transform hook
esbuild.footer -> custom plugin using transform hook
The esbuild.supported option is not supported by Oxc. If you need this option, please see oxc-project/oxc#15373.

You can get the options set by the compatibility layer from the configResolved hook:

const plugin = {
name: 'log-config',
configResolved(config) {
console.log('options', config.oxc)
},
},
Currently, the Oxc transformer does not support lowering native decorators as we are waiting for the specification to progress, see (oxc-project/oxc#9170).

esbuild Fallbacks
esbuild is no longer directly used by Vite and is now an optional dependency. If you are using a plugin that uses the transformWithEsbuild function, you need to install esbuild as a devDependency. The transformWithEsbuild function is deprecated and will be removed in the future. We recommend migrating to the new transformWithOxc function instead.

JavaScript Minification by Oxc
The Oxc Minifier is now used for JavaScript minification instead of esbuild. You can use the deprecated build.minify: 'esbuild' option to switch back to esbuild. This configuration option will be removed in the future and you need install esbuild as a devDependency as Vite no longer relies on esbuild directly.

If you were using the esbuild.minify* options to control minification behavior, you can now use build.rolldownOptions.output.minify instead. If you were using the esbuild.drop option, you can now use build.rolldownOptions.output.minify.compress.drop* options.

Property mangling and its related options (mangleProps, reserveProps, mangleQuoted, mangleCache) are not supported by Oxc. If you need these options, please see oxc-project/oxc#15375.

esbuild and Oxc Minifier make slightly different assumptions about source code. In case you suspect the minifier is causing breakage in your code, you can compare these assumptions here:

esbuild minify assumptions
Oxc Minifier assumptions
Please report any issues you find related to minification in your JavaScript apps.

CSS Minification by Lightning CSS
Lightning CSS is now used for CSS minification by default. You can use the build.cssMinify: 'esbuild' option to switch back to esbuild. Note that you need to install esbuild as a devDependency.

Lightning CSS supports better syntax lowering and your CSS bundle size might increase slightly.

Consistent CommonJS Interop
The default import from a CommonJS (CJS) module is now handled in a consistent way.

If it matches one of the following conditions, the default import is the module.exports value of the importee CJS module. Otherwise, the default import is the module.exports.default value of the importee CJS module:

The importer is .mjs or .mts.
The closest package.json for the importer has a type field set to module.
The module.exports.\_\_esModule value of the importee CJS module is not set to true.
See Rolldown's docs about this problem for more details: Ambiguous default import from CJS modules - Bundling CJS | Rolldown.

This change may break some existing code importing CJS modules. You can use the deprecated legacy.inconsistentCjsInterop: true option to temporarily restore the previous behavior. If you find a package that is affected by this change, please report it to the package author or send them a pull request. Make sure to link to the Rolldown documentation above so that the author can understand the context.

Removed Module Resolution Using Format Sniffing
When both browser and module fields are present in package.json, Vite used to resolve the field based on the content of the file and it used to pick the ESM file for browsers. This was introduced because some packages were using the module field to point to ESM files for Node.js and some other packages were using the browser field to point to UMD files for browsers. Given that the modern exports field solved this problem and is now adopted by many packages, Vite no longer uses this heuristic and always respects the order of the resolve.mainFields option. If you were relying on this behavior, you can use the resolve.alias option to map the field to the desired file or apply a patch with your package manager (e.g. patch-package, pnpm patch).

Require Calls For Externalized Modules
require calls for externalized modules are now preserved as require calls and not converted to import statements. This is to preserve the semantics of require calls. If you want to convert them to import statements, you can use Rolldown's built-in esmExternalRequirePlugin, which is re-exported from vite.

import { defineConfig, esmExternalRequirePlugin } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
// ...
plugins: [
esmExternalRequirePlugin({
external: ['react', 'vue', /^node:/],
}),
],
})
See Rolldown's docs for more details: require external modules - Bundling CJS | Rolldown.

import.meta.url in UMD / IIFE
import.meta.url is no longer polyfilled in UMD / IIFE output formats. It will be replaced with undefined by default. If you prefer the previous behavior, you can use the define option with build.rolldownOptions.output.intro option. See Rolldown's docs for more details: Well-known import.meta properties - Non ESM Output Formats | Rolldown.

Removed build.rollupOptions.watch.chokidar option
The build.rollupOptions.watch.chokidar option was removed. Please migrate to the build.rolldownOptions.watch.watcher option.

Removed object form build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks and deprecate function form one
The object form output.manualChunks option is not supported anymore. The function form output.manualChunks is deprecated. Rolldown has the more flexible codeSplitting option. See Rolldown's docs for more details about codeSplitting: Manual Code Splitting - Rolldown.

build() Throws BundleError
This change only affects JS API users.

build() now throws a BundleError instead of the raw error thrown in the plugin. BundleError is typed as Error & { errors?: RolldownError[] } and it wraps the individual errors in an errors array. If you need the individual errors, you need to access .errors:

try {
await build()
} catch (e) {
if (e.errors) {
for (const error of e.errors) {
console.log(error.code) // error code
}
}
}
Module Type Support and Auto Detection
This change only affects plugin authors.

Rolldown has experimental support for Module types, similar to esbuild's loader option. Due to this, Rolldown automatically sets a module type based on the extension of the resolved id. If you are converting content from other module types to JavaScript in load or transform hooks, you may need to add moduleType: 'js' to the returned value:

const plugin = {
name: 'txt-loader',
load(id) {
if (id.endsWith('.txt')) {
const content = fs.readFile(id, 'utf-8')
return {
code: `export default ${JSON.stringify(content)}`,
moduleType: 'js',
}
}
},
}
Other Related Deprecations
The following options are deprecated and will be removed in the future:

build.rollupOptions: renamed to build.rolldownOptions
worker.rollupOptions: renamed to worker.rolldownOptions
build.commonjsOptions: it is now no-op
build.dynamicImportVarsOptions.warnOnError: it is now no-op
resolve.alias[].customResolver: Use a custom plugin with resolveId hook and enforce: 'pre' instead
Removed Deprecated Features NRV
Passing an URL to import.meta.hot.accept is no longer supported. Please pass an id instead. (#21382)
Advanced
These breaking changes are expected to only affect a minority of use cases:

Extglobs are not supported yet (rolldown-vite#365)
TypeScript legacy namespace is only supported partially. See Oxc Transformer's related documentation for more details.
define does not share reference for objects: When you pass an object as a value to define, each variable will have a separate copy of the object. See Oxc Transformer's related documentation for more details.
bundle object changes (bundle is an object passed in generateBundle / writeBundle hooks, returned by build function):
Assigning to bundle[foo] is not supported. This is discouraged by Rollup as well. Please use this.emitFile() instead.
the reference is not shared across the hooks (rolldown-vite#410)
structuredClone(bundle) errors with DataCloneError: #<Object> could not be cloned. This is not supported anymore. Please clone it with structuredClone({ ...bundle }). (rolldown-vite#128)
All parallel hooks in Rollup works as sequential hooks. See Rolldown's documentation for more details.
"use strict"; is not injected sometimes. See Rolldown's documentation for more details.
Transforming to ES5 and below with plugin-legacy is not supported (rolldown-vite#452)
Passing the same browser with multiple versions of it to build.target option now errors: esbuild selects the latest version of it, which was probably not what you intended.
Missing support by Rolldown: The following features are not supported by Rolldown and is no longer supported by Vite.
build.rollupOptions.output.format: 'system' (rolldown#2387)
build.rollupOptions.output.format: 'amd' (rolldown#2387)
shouldTransformCachedModule hook (rolldown#4389)
resolveImportMeta hook (rolldown#1010)
renderDynamicImport hook (rolldown#4532)
resolveFileUrl hook
parseAst / parseAstAsync functions are now deprecated in favor of parseSync / parse functions which have more features.

Migration from v6
Node.js Support
Vite no longer supports Node.js 18, which reached its EOL. Node.js 20.19+ / 22.12+ is now required.

Default Browser Target change
The default browser value of build.target is updated to a newer browser.

Chrome 87 → 107
Edge 88 → 107
Firefox 78 → 104
Safari 14.0 → 16.0
These browser versions align with Baseline Widely Available feature sets as of 2025-05-01. In other words, they were all released before 2022-11-01.

In Vite 5, the default target was named 'modules', but this is no longer available. Instead, a new default target 'baseline-widely-available' is introduced.

General Changes
Removed Sass legacy API support
As planned, support for the Sass legacy API is removed. Vite now only supports the modern API. You can remove the css.preprocessorOptions.sass.api / css.preprocessorOptions.scss.api option.

Removed deprecated features
splitVendorChunkPlugin (deprecated in v5.2.7)
This plugin was originally provided to ease migration to Vite v2.9.
The build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks option can be used to control the chunking behavior if needed.
Hook-level enforce / transform for transformIndexHtml (deprecated in v4.0.0)
It was changed to align the interface with Rollup's object hooks.
order should be used instead of enforce, and handler should be used instead of transform.
